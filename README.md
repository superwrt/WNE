# WNE(Windows Nginx Environment)
WNE is developed for running some php sites on Windows PC.

WNE is different from some other Nginx/PHP environments on Windows. WNE is design for end users, not for developers.

Developer can package the WNE and configure file togehter, then send it to end user.

Thanks for WNMP project. WNE used some codes from WNMP project.
